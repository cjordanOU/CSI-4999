## How to run the website using PHP
The easiest way to run this website using PHP on your own local computer is to download and install XAMPP. https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html After installing, move the unzipped CSI-4999 folder inside of the htdocs directory in xampp. Next, make sure Apache is running from the XAMPP Control Panel. You should now be able to see the website running at http://localhost/CSI-4999/index.php (or whatever your folder is named that is the root directory containing index.php)
